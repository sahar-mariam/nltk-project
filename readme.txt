About:
This Python project is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) application built using NLTK and Streamlit. The app is designed to help users explore word meanings and synonyms in an interactive way. Users can input any word of their choice and select an option to either retrieve its meanings or find synonyms.

The application leverages WordNet, a large lexical database, to fetch and display possible meanings and synonyms of the input word. When users choose to get meanings, the app presents all available definitions. If they opt for synonyms, the app returns a list of related words.

Requirements:
To run this application, you need to have `nltk` and `streamlit` installed in your Python environment. 
Install these packages using `pip install nltk streamlit`.

How to Run:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running `streamlit run <script_name>.py` in your terminal. The app will open in your web browser, where you can enter a word and select an option to get the desired output.

This project provides a straightforward way to explore the meanings and synonyms of words, making it a useful tool for anyone interested in language processing.
